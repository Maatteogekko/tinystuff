# Exercise 02

Thank you! The code you created last time was really useful to the frontend and UI/UX team.
Now they gave us additional requirement to let users to have more control over their short URLs, allowing them to:

- Create new shortened URLs: `POST /urls`
  - Accepts a JSON body with a destination URL and a userId
  - Generates a new, unique urlId (e.g., c7H8i9) and adds a new URL object to the urls array.
  - Responds with the newly created URL object, including the urlId, destination, and userId.
  - If any field is missing from the data sent by the client, it returns a 400 status code with an error message.
- Delete existing shortened URLs: `DELETE /urls/:urlId`
  - Deletes the URL with the specified urlId.
  - If successful, returns a 200 status code with a success message.
  - If the URL is not found, returns a 404 status code with an error message.
  - Users must always have at least a URL, meaning that they cannot delete their last URL.

Hearing that you are working on this project, your colleague Anita shared with you code that she wrote to generate random strings in javascript.

There are certainly more efficient libraries out there that do the same thing, but since we are doing a mock server, itâ€™s not such a big deal to use her function.

Here it is:

```javascript
function generateRandomString(length) {
  const alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789';
  let result = '';
  for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    result += alphabet.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * alphabet.length));
  }
  return result;
}
```
